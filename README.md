# Task Manager â€“ OOP Project in C++

This project is a **collaborative task management system** developed in **C++**, applying the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. It simulates how different usersâ€”such as administrators and collaboratorsâ€”interact within a shared project where tasks can be created, assigned, and completed.

## ðŸ§© Key Features:
- **Class inheritance** (`User`, `Administrator`, `Collaborator`)
- Use of **constructors** and **custom methods**
- **Class relationships** through composition and aggregation
- Functions include: task creation, marking tasks as completed, displaying tasks, and user assignment

## ðŸ’¡ Educational Purpose:
This project demonstrates practical OOP usage in C++, ideal for academic assignments or as a base for more advanced systems. It helps learners understand class hierarchies and good object design practices.
